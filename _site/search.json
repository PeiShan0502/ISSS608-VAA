    "text": "Beyond Single Graph\nIt is not unusual that multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions that provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, you will learn how to create composite plot by combining multiple graphs.\nFirst, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\n#Plot 1: Distribution of Maths scores\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n#Plot 2: Distribution of English scores\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\n\np2\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below:\n\n# Plot 3: English scores vs Maths scores\np3 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\np3\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating Composite Graphics: pathwork methods\nThere are several ggplot2 extension functions that support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package.\nIn this section, we are going to use a ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is\n\nspecially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure\n\n.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\nCombining two ggplot2 graphs\nThe figures below shows a composite of two histograms created using the patchwork package:\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about this, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\nCreating a composite figure with auto-tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\nOther examples which I tried for fun:\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = '1')\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'a')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating figure with inset_element()\nBesides providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggthemes\nThe figure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: how to adjust the axis title size and axis label size, so that the plots appear nicely…?"
