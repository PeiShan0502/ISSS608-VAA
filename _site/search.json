Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\nCombining two ggplot2 graphs\nThe figures below shows a composite of two histograms created using the patchwork package:\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about this, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\nCreating a composite figure with auto-tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\nOther examples which I tried for fun:\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = '1')\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'a')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating figure with inset_element()\nBesides providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggthemes\nThe figure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: how to adjust the axis title size and axis label size, so that the plots appear nicely…?\n\nTrying callout tip:\n```{::: {.callout-tip} ## Tip with Title\nThis is an example of a callout with a title. :::\n\n```{::: {.callout-tip title=\"Tip with Title\"}\nThis is a callout with a title.\n:::"

    "section": "Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot",
    "text": "Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\nPlotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nggplot(exam_df, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nggplot(exam_df, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

    "text": "Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation technique that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\nPlotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nggplot(exam_df, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n#We remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\nAdding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nggplot(exam_df, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nggplot(exam_df, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nggplot(exam_df, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()"
