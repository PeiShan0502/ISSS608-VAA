They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse and [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling time data will be installed and launched too.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, \n               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,\n               tidyverse, graphlayouts)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## **The Data**\n\nThe data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges data.\n\n### **The edges data**\n\n-   *GAStech-email_edges.csv* which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondences between 55 employees.\n\n### **The nodes data**\n\n-   *GAStech_email_nodes.csv* which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.\n\n### **Importing network data from files**\n\nIn this step, you will import GAStech_email_node.csv and GAStech_email_edges-v2.csv into RStudio environment by using `read_csv()` of **readr** package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_nodes <- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_node.csv\")\nGAStech_edges <- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### **Reviewing the imported data**\n\nNext, we will examine the structure of the data frame using *glimpse()* of **dplyr**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(GAStech_edges)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 9,063\nColumns: 8\n$ source      <dbl> 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26…\n$ target      <dbl> 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29…\n$ SentDate    <chr> \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\"…\n$ SentTime    <time> 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0…\n$ Subject     <chr> \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP…\n$ MainSubject <chr> \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela…\n$ sourceLabel <chr> \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr…\n$ targetLabel <chr> \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe output report of GAStech_edges above reveals that the *SentDate* is treated as “Character” data type instead of *date* data type. This is an error! Before we continue, it is important for us to change the data type of *SentDate* field back to “Date”” data type.\n\n### **Wrangling time**\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the changes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_edges <- GAStech_edges %>%\n  mutate(SendDate = dmy(SentDate)) %>%\n  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,\n                        label = TRUE,\n                        abbr = FALSE))\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   both *dmy()* and *wday()* are functions of **lubridate** package. [lubridate](https://r4va.netlify.app/cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html) is an R package that makes it easier to work with dates and times.\n\n-   *dmy()* transforms the SentDate to Date data type.\n\n-   *wday()* returns the day of the week as a decimal number or an ordered factor if label is TRUE. The argument abbr = FALSE keeps the day spelling in full, i.e. Monday. The function will create a new column in the data.frame i.e. Weekday and the output of *wday()* will save in this newly created field.\n\n-   the values in the *Weekday* field are in ordinal scale.\n\n### **Reviewing the revised date fields**\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted *GAStech_edges* data frame:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(GAStech_edges)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 9,063\nColumns: 10\n$ source      <dbl> 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26…\n$ target      <dbl> 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29…\n$ SentDate    <chr> \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\"…\n$ SentTime    <time> 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0…\n$ Subject     <chr> \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP…\n$ MainSubject <chr> \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela…\n$ sourceLabel <chr> \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr…\n$ targetLabel <chr> \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc…\n$ SendDate    <date> 2014-01-06, 2014-01-06, 2014-01-06, 2014-01-06, 2014-01-0…\n$ Weekday     <ord> Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Fr…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### **Wrangling attributes**\n\nA close examination of *GAStech_edges* data.frame reveals that it consists of individual e-mail flow records. This is not very useful for visualisation.\n\nIn view of this, we will aggregate the individual by date, senders, receivers, main subject and day of the week.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nGAStech_edges_aggregated <- GAStech_edges %>%\n  filter(MainSubject == \"Work related\") %>%\n  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %>%\n    summarise(Weight = n()) %>%\n  filter(source!=target) %>%\n  filter(Weight > 1) %>%\n  ungroup()\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   four functions from **dplyr** package are used. They are: *filter()*, *group()*, *summarise()*, and *ungroup()*.\n\n-   The output data.frame is called **GAStech_edges_aggregated**.\n\n-   A new field called *Weight* has been added in GAStech_edges_aggregated.\n\n### **Reviewing the revised edges file**\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted *GAStech_edges_aggregated* data frame\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(GAStech_edges_aggregated)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 1,372\nColumns: 4\n$ source  <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…\n$ target  <dbl> 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6,…\n$ Weekday <ord> Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Monday, Tu…\n$ Weight  <int> 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5,…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## **Creating network objects using tidygraph**\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a graph data model by using **tidygraph** package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\n\n-   [Introducing tidygraph](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/)\n\n-   [tidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2018/tidygraph-1-1-a-tidy-hope/)\n\n### **The tbl_graph object**\n\nTwo functions of **tidygraph** package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\n-   [`tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) creates a **tbl_graph** network object from nodes and edges data.\n\n-   [`as_tbl_graph()`](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/reference/tbl_graph.html) converts network data and objects to a **tbl_graph** network. Below are network data and objects supported by `as_tbl_graph()`\n\n    -   a node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\n\n    -   data.frame, list, matrix from base,\n\n    -   igraph from igraph,\n\n    -   network from network,\n\n    -   dendrogram and hclust from stats,\n\n    -   Node from data.tree,\n\n    -   phylo and evonet from ape, and\n\n    -   graphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n### **The dplyr verbs in tidygraph**\n\n-   *activate()* verb from **tidygraph** serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to **tbl_graph** object are applied to the active tibble.\n",
